## Problem

Physical therapy relies heavily on patient adherence to prescribed exercises, but studies show that only 35% of patients fully comply with their home exercise programs. Key barriers include:

- **Lack of feedback**: Patients unsure if they're performing exercises correctly
- **Motivation gaps**: No visibility into progress over time
- **Therapist limitations**: PT sessions too infrequent for adequate monitoring
- **Subjectivity**: Movement quality assessments vary between therapists

Similarly, in sports performance, athletes and coaches struggle to:
- Quantify technique improvements
- Identify subtle movement compensations
- Track recovery and fatigue patterns

## My Role

As Technical Lead, I was responsible for:

- Designing the computer vision pipeline for pose estimation
- Developing biomechanical analysis algorithms
- Building the mobile application architecture
- Managing a small cross-functional team
- Coordinating with PT clinics for clinical validation

## Approach

### Research Phase

We started by understanding the core biomechanical principles that physical therapists use to assess movement quality:

1. **Joint angles**: Range of motion at key joints
2. **Symmetry**: Left/right balance in bilateral movements
3. **Control**: Smoothness and stability of movement
4. **Compensation patterns**: Unwanted movements indicating weakness or pain

We also interviewed 20+ physical therapists to understand their assessment workflows and pain points.

### Technical Architecture

**Pose Estimation Pipeline**
We built on MediaPipe Pose for real-time body tracking, adding custom post-processing for:
- Temporal smoothing to reduce jitter
- Confidence-weighted joint position refinement
- Automatic camera angle calibration

**Biomechanical Analysis Engine**
Custom algorithms computed:
- Joint angles in 3D space (accounting for camera perspective)
- Movement velocity and acceleration profiles
- Repetition counting and segmentation
- Deviation from prescribed movement patterns

**Feedback System**
Real-time audio and visual cues helped patients correct form:
- Color-coded joint highlighting
- Verbal instructions for common errors
- Rep counting with quality scores
- Progress visualization over time

### Mobile Application

Built with React Native for cross-platform deployment:

**Patient Features**
- Guided exercise sessions with real-time feedback
- Progress tracking and goal setting
- Direct messaging with therapist
- Exercise video library

**Therapist Features**
- Patient progress dashboard
- Exercise prescription builder
- Async video review with annotation
- Outcome tracking and reporting

## Impact

After 6 months of development and 4 months of clinical pilots:

- **30% improvement** in patient adherence to home exercise programs
- **500+ patients** used the platform across pilot clinics
- **15 PT clinics** adopted MuscleMetrics
- **4.6/5 star** average user rating
- **92% of therapists** reported improved patient communication

Qualitative feedback highlighted:
- Patients felt more confident exercising independently
- Therapists valued objective data for progress tracking
- Athletes appreciated the detailed performance insights

## Learnings

### Technical Insights

**Pose estimation has limitations**
Consumer-grade cameras and 2D pose estimation introduce errors, especially for rotational movements. We learned to design algorithms robust to these limitations rather than fighting them.

**Context matters for feedback**
Generic form corrections frustrated users. Personalized guidance based on their specific movement patterns and injury history was far more effective.

**Real-time processing is hard**
Balancing analysis depth with frame rate on mobile devices required careful optimization. We developed a tiered system: real-time for basic feedback, detailed analysis post-session.

### Product Learnings

**Therapist buy-in is crucial**
Early versions focused too much on patient-facing features. Adding robust therapist tools transformed adoption, as therapists became advocates for the platform.

**Gamification works (carefully)**
Progress tracking and streaks improved adherence, but we had to be careful not to encourage overexertion in recovering patients.

### What I'd Do Differently

- Start with a narrower exercise set before expanding
- Invest more in user onboarding and education
- Build therapist tools first, then patient features
- Consider wearable sensors for higher-accuracy use cases

*This project taught me that the best technical solutions are useless without deep understanding of user needs. The breakthrough came not from better algorithms, but from designing a product that fit naturally into existing clinical workflows.*
