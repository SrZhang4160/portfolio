## Problem

Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, affecting over 3 million Americans. Treatment success depends heavily on patient adherence to medication and regular monitoring. However, many patients struggle with:

- **Understanding their condition**: Glaucoma is complex and often asymptomatic until advanced
- **Medication adherence**: Eye drops must be taken consistently, often multiple times daily
- **Tracking progress**: Patients can't easily see how their condition is changing over time
- **Appointment preparation**: Forgetting to bring relevant information to doctor visits

## My Role

As Full-Stack Developer, I led the project from concept to launch:

- Designed and implemented the mobile app architecture
- Built the backend API and database infrastructure
- Developed the visual field simulation feature
- Integrated with Apple HealthKit and Google Fit
- Coordinated with ophthalmologists on clinical accuracy

## Approach

### Research & Discovery

We conducted extensive user research with glaucoma patients:

1. Interviewed 30+ patients about their daily challenges
2. Shadowed ophthalmology appointments to understand clinical workflows
3. Analyzed existing apps in the space to identify gaps
4. Tested paper prototypes with target users

Key insight: Patients wanted to *understand* their condition, not just track medications.

### Core Features

**Visual Field Simulation**

The standout feature was an interactive simulation showing how glaucoma affects vision:

- Personalized based on patient's test results
- Side-by-side comparison of healthy vs. affected vision
- Progressive demonstration of potential disease advancement
- Approved by ophthalmology advisors for clinical accuracy

**Medication Tracking**

Built a comprehensive medication management system:

- Smart reminders with customizable schedules
- Technique guides for proper eye drop administration
- Streak tracking and gentle gamification for adherence
- Integration with pharmacy refill reminders

**Health Dashboard**

Created a patient-friendly view of their eye health:

- IOP (intraocular pressure) history charts
- Visual field test result trends
- Upcoming appointment reminders
- Exportable reports for doctor visits

**Educational Content**

Developed a library of patient-friendly resources:

- Animated explainers about glaucoma types
- Lifestyle tips for eye health
- FAQ addressing common patient concerns
- New research updates in accessible language

### Technical Implementation

**Mobile Architecture**

Built with React Native for cross-platform support:

- Offline-first design for reliability
- Local SQLite for sensitive health data
- Secure sync with cloud backup
- Push notifications via Firebase

**Backend Services**

Node.js API with Firebase infrastructure:

- User authentication with biometric support
- HIPAA-compliant data storage
- Analytics for feature usage insights
- Content management for educational materials

## Impact

After 7 months of development and launch:

- **4.8 star rating** on both App Store and Google Play
- **15,000+ downloads** in the first year
- **78% monthly active user rate** (well above healthcare app averages)
- **Featured by** American Glaucoma Society in patient resources
- **Qualitative feedback**: Patients report feeling more confident in managing their condition

## Learnings

### What Worked Well

- **Patient co-design**: Having patients involved throughout led to features that truly resonated
- **Clinical validation**: Ophthalmologist review ensured accuracy and built trust
- **Simple onboarding**: Minimal setup friction led to higher activation rates

### What I'd Do Differently

- **Earlier EHR integration**: Patients wanted automatic data import from their doctors
- **Family accounts**: Caregivers often manage medications for elderly patients

### Personal Reflection

This project was deeply meaningful because it addressed a real human need. Hearing from users who said the app helped them understand their diagnosis for the first time was incredibly rewarding.

*GlaucomaLife taught me that the best healthcare apps don't just track data—they empower patients to become active participants in their care.*
