## Context

Brachytherapy treatment planning requires specialized expertise and can be time-consuming. AutoBrachy was developed to assist clinicians with AI-generated treatment plans that could be reviewed and refined through an intuitive interface.

The project involved:

- An algorithm engineer developing the treatment planning AI
- A researcher handling clinical validation
- My role building the frontend interface

## My Role

As the Frontend Engineer, I was responsible for:

- Building the Angular-based treatment planning interface
- Integrating with the Django backend API
- Implementing visualization components for treatment plans
- Developing the review and refinement workflow
- Creating the clinical dashboard for plan management

## Technical Implementation

### Angular Frontend

Built a responsive single-page application using Angular:

- Component-based architecture for reusable UI elements
- RxJS for reactive state management
- Lazy loading for optimized bundle size
- Form handling for treatment parameters

### Django Integration

Worked with the Django backend built by the algorithm team:

- REST API consumption for plan data
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates during plan generation
- Authentication and session management
- File upload handling for patient imaging data

### Treatment Planning Workflow

Developed the core clinical workflow interface:

**Plan Visualization**
- 2D slice views showing radiation dose distributions
- Dose-volume histogram (DVH) charts
- Color-coded overlays for target and organs-at-risk

**Review Interface**
- Side-by-side comparison of alternative plans
- Constraint satisfaction indicators
- Clinical metrics dashboard

**Refinement Tools**
- Parameter adjustment controls
- Re-optimization triggers
- Plan approval workflow

### Clinical Dashboard

Created a management interface for clinical staff:

- Patient queue and plan status tracking
- Historical plan archive with search
- Export functionality for clinical reports
- User role management

## Collaboration

Working as a small team required close collaboration:

- Daily syncs with the algorithm engineer on API contracts
- Regular feedback sessions with clinical advisors
- Iterative design based on user testing with radiation oncologists

## Learnings

### What Worked Well

- **Angular's structure**: Strong typing and dependency injection helped maintain code quality
- **Clear API contracts**: Well-defined interfaces with the Django backend reduced integration issues
- **Early clinical feedback**: User testing with actual clinicians caught UX problems early

### What I'd Do Differently

- **More upfront design**: Some UI refactoring needed as requirements evolved
- **Better loading states**: Complex visualizations needed more polish for slow network conditions

### Technical Insights

- Medical software UX must prioritize clarity over aesthetics
- Clinical workflows have many edge cases that require careful handling
- Real-time updates are important for interactive planning tools

*This project taught me the value of building software that augments expert decision-making rather than replacing it—the interface needed to empower clinicians while keeping them in control.*
